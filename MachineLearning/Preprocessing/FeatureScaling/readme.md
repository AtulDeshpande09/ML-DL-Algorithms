# ⚙️ Feature Scaling Techniques

This repository contains mini-implementations of popular **feature scaling** and **normalization techniques**, each written from scratch as part of a hands-on learning project.

Each method includes:
- Theoretical explanation
- Mathematical formula
- Python implementation
- Visualization of results
