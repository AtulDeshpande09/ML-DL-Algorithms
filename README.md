## 🔥 Introduction  
This repository serves as a **personal research and implementation hub** for ML & DL algorithms, covering:  
✅ **Supervised Learning** (Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, etc.)  
✅ **Unsupervised Learning** (PCA, K-means Clustering, etc.)  
✅ **Preprocessing Techniques** (Feature Scaling, Encoding Methods)  
✅ **Deep Learning Basics** (Neural Networks, XOR Problem, CNNs, etc.)  
✅ **Projects** (Digit Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, etc.)  

The goal is to provide **hands-on implementations** of these concepts without relying heavily on libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for core algorithms.
