## ðŸ§  Algorithms & Accuracy

A range of models were trained and evaluated. Below are the accuracy scores:

| Algorithm            | Accuracy   |
|----------------------|------------|
| SVM                  | 92.80%     |
| Logistic Regression  | 92.21%     |
| Random Forest        | 95.86%     |
| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | **98.99%** |
